          <h1 class="h2">About</h1>
          <p class="lead">I am a dedicated and motivated B.Sc. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning student at Sri Krishna Adithya College of Arts and Science, with a strong academic foundation in machine learning, data science, and modern software development. I am passionate about exploring how intelligent systems can solve real-world problems and create meaningful digital experiences. With a consistent focus on learning and innovation, I strive to combine technical expertise with creativity to deliver practical, scalable, and user-centric solutions.</p>
          <p>My technical skill set includes Python, Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL, enabling me to build full-stack and AI-driven applications. I have hands-on experience developing projects such as a Django-based online quiz platform, a machine learning stock price prediction system, and an interactive frontend for a movie recommendation website. These projects reflect my ability to design responsive interfaces, implement secure backend logic, and apply data-driven models to enhance functionality and user engagement.</p>
          <p>Through multiple internships, workshops, and professional certifications from organizations such as Microsoft, IBM, NPTEL, Coursera, and Great Learning, I have gained practical exposure to artificial intelligence, web development, and data analytics. These experiences have strengthened my problem-solving abilities, adaptability, and teamwork skills, while also helping me stay aligned with the latest industry trends and emerging technologies in AI and software development.</p>
          <p>I am eager to collaborate with forward-thinking teams and contribute to impactful, technology-driven initiatives. My goal is to continuously grow as an AI and software professional by working on challenging projects that push the boundaries of innovation. I bring a strong work ethic, a passion for learning, and a commitment to excellence, and I look forward to building intelligent solutions that create real value for users and organizations alike.</p>
